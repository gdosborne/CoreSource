Use the "ARROW" (up/down/left/right) to move one 
line or column at a time in the Illustration Preview.  Use
"PAGE UP" and "PAGE DOWN" to move 21 lines at a 
time.  Use "END" to view the leftmost portion of a 
line, and "HOME" to get back to the text on the right.
Use the provided scroll bars to move up, down or to 
the left or right in larger increments.
The illustration you are seeing on the display will be an
exact replication of the printed illustration, should you
choose to print it.

Click the "QUIT" menu item (or press ALT-Q) to return 
to the illustration parameter display.  Nothing is printed 
or saved, but you can redisplay the illustration as many 
times as you like from the previous parameter display.
"QUIT" or double-clicking the upper left hand icon are
the only ways to leave this display.

Click the "PRINT" menu item (or press ALT-P) to open
the printer options.  You can set printer types, print 
fonts or send the currently viewed illustration to be
printed.  A message ("Illustration being printed") will
appear.
