Guaranteed Values:  Based on the guaranteed interest rate of 4.00% and the
                    guaranteed cost of insurance.

Projected Values:   Based on an assumed interest rate of XXXX% and the current
                    cost of insurance, which is subject to change.  Projected
                    values are based on an assumed long-term interest rate
                    which is hypothetical and is neither guaranteed nor is it
                    an estimate for the future.


Any increase in the specified amount may require underwriting.

This is an illustration and not a contract.

As a result of rounding techniques and computer processing variations, the
results illustrated may be slightly different than the actual Life Savings 
policy.
